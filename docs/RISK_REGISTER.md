## Notes

- **Owner**: Placeholder "TBD" until project team assigned
- **Status**: Most risks are "Open" in research phase
- Risks will be updated as project progresses
- Critical risks require immediate attention and mitigation plans

## Risk Review Process

- Review quarterly or at major milestones
- Update likelihood/impact based on new information
- Close risks that are no longer relevant
- Escalate critical risks to project leadership
