# Glossary

## A

**Allan deviation**: Statistical measure of frequency stability in clocks and oscillators. Characterizes noise processes (white, flicker, random walk).

**Atom interferometry**: Technique using matter-wave interference of atoms (e.g., rubidium) to measure acceleration, rotation, or gravitational fields with high precision.

## B

**Bias instability**: Long-term drift in sensor outputs, typically characterized by the minimum of the Allan deviation curve. Units: m/s² (accelerometer) or deg/hr (gyroscope).

## C

**Constellation**: Multiple spacecraft working together, often for distributed sensing, navigation, or communication.

## D

**Drift**: Systematic error that accumulates over time, often due to bias instability or integration of noise.

## F

**Frame-dragging**: General relativistic effect where a rotating mass (e.g., Earth, black hole) drags spacetime around it, causing precession of nearby orbits. Also called Lense-Thirring effect.

## G

**GR (General Relativity)**: Einstein's theory of gravity, describing how mass-energy curves spacetime.

**Gravitational lensing**: Bending of light by gravitational fields, predicted by GR. Can cause multiple images, time delays, and magnification.

**Gravitational waves**: Ripples in spacetime caused by accelerating masses. Detected by LIGO/Virgo at strain levels ~10^-21.

**Gravitational redshift**: Frequency shift of light due to gravitational potential differences. Clocks run slower in stronger gravitational fields.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: Sensor package containing accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure linear acceleration and angular velocity.

**Interferometer**: Instrument using wave interference to measure phase differences, path lengths, or frequency shifts. Examples: Michelson (LIGO), atom interferometer (acceleration sensing).

## K

**Kalman filter**: Recursive algorithm for state estimation that optimally combines predictions and measurements, accounting for uncertainty.

## L

**Lensing**: See gravitational lensing.

## M

**MOT (Magneto-Optical Trap)**: Technique for cooling and trapping atoms using magnetic fields and laser light. Common first stage in atom interferometry.

## N

**Noise**: Random fluctuations in measurements. Types: white (uncorrelated), colored (correlated), random walk (integrated white noise).

## O

**Orbital dynamics**: Motion of objects under gravitational influence, typically described by Kepler's laws and perturbations.

## P

**Particle filter**: Monte Carlo method for state estimation in nonlinear/non-Gaussian systems, using weighted particles to represent probability distributions.

**Post-Newtonian**: Approximation to GR valid when gravitational fields are weak and velocities are non-relativistic. Adds corrections to Newtonian gravity.

## R

**Random walk**: Stochastic process where each step is independent. When integrated, white noise becomes a random walk (e.g., bias drift).

**Relativity**: See GR (General Relativity).

## S

**Sagnac effect**: Phase shift in interferometers due to rotation. Basis for ring laser gyroscopes.

**Sensor fusion**: Combining measurements from multiple sensors to improve accuracy and robustness.

**Shapiro delay**: Time delay of light signals due to gravitational fields, predicted by GR.

**State estimation**: Process of inferring system state (position, velocity, attitude, etc.) from noisy measurements.

## T

**Timing**: Precision measurement of time intervals, critical for navigation, synchronization, and detecting gravitational effects.

**Two-body problem**: Classical orbital mechanics problem: motion of two point masses under mutual gravitational attraction. Has analytical solution (Keplerian orbits).

## U

**Units**: Physical quantities must have consistent units. This repo uses SI units (m, kg, s) with explicit conversions.

## V

**Vacuum**: Low-pressure environment required for atom interferometry. Typically < 10^-9 Torr (ultra-high vacuum).
