## Cosmic Compass
### GPS for Deep Space

OutOfThisWorld — autonomous navigation via gravitational sensing.

---

## The problem
- Deep space navigation is **blind**
- Star trackers drift, comms delays grow, GNSS is absent
- Autonomous guidance needs a **new absolute reference**

---

## The insight
Compact objects imprint measurable **gravity signatures**

- Neutron stars / black holes create distinct fields
- A spacecraft can infer position by matching the observed signature

---

## The sensor
**Atom interferometry** measures acceleration with extreme sensitivity

- Phase shift ∝ gravity
- Enables passive, jam-proof navigation

---

## What you’re seeing in the demo
- 3D flyby trajectory around a neutron star
- Uncertainty collapsing from **100 km → 100 m**
- Heatmap of log₁₀(|g|) over the flyby plane

---

## Why it matters
Autonomous navigation unlocks:
- Deep space exploration without constant ground support
- Resilient operations in contested environments
- Faster mission timelines and reduced ops cost

---

## Next
We’re building:
- Higher-fidelity physics + estimation
- Realistic sensor models + error budgets
- A shareable web demo for partners
